Dear Hiring Manager,


I am a masterâ€™s student studying International Human Resource Management at Grenoble Ecole de Management, looking forward in doing an internship at Mondelez International. I am excited to learn more about your firm and curios how such an efficient invention can help a providing creative solutions. Given a chance, I would like to learn from your organisation by putting in my efforts to meet our targets.

I have worked for three years with Standard Chartered GBS as a quality assurance engineer with people centric and project management roles where I was responsible for liaising between 5 team situated in different countries like Hong Kong, China, Kenya, Nigeria, Malaysia, India and Singapore. Currently, I am also working for BASSETTI group as a student consultant for defining their recruitment strategies and finding the loop holes in the current one. We as a group of 3 are required to build strategies for effective recruitment for people to the BASSETTI Talent pool from Canada, India, China, France and Germany. I have also been studying Process Communication Model which helps me understand the 6 personalities that people have and that would help me drive people to learn and develop by providing them the right fuel.

My education and experience in a multinational environment and my internship in recruitments would help me do justice to the challenges offered at Mondelez International.

Looking forward to hearing from you for a discussion.

Thank you in advance for your time.


Regards,
Shweta Nambiar
